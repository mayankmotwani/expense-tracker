# Expense Tracker
This web application empowers users to track their income and expenditures through an interactive and responsive dashboard. It facilitates the categorization of transactions into various segments such as salary, freelance, food, travel, medical, education, etc. The platform not only presents colorful and dynamic visualizations but also offers insights, enabling users to analyze their financial activities and gain a comprehensive understanding of their spending patterns.

## Tech Stack
The front-end is crafted using React and the Ant Design JavaScript libraries, ensuring a premium appearance and a responsive user interface.

On the back-end, the Node.js platform along with the Express framework has been used. MongoDB (Atlas) is employed for database infrastructure, contributing to the application's robustness.
